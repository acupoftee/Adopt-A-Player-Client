## Planning
The design was inspired by [Discord's](https://discord.gg) color scheme as it's the main hub for gamers and nerds alike! This type of design isn't ubiquitous yet, so it was important to still remain inclusive whien designing this. Mobile first design principles were applied first and foremost, and future iterations will continue to prioritize it.

Problem solving strategies involved were first creating a plan on paper, then translating it into psuedocode, and finally coded the solution. The [SEI issue tracker](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/issues) helped with arriving at solutions with my own approach. Error Driven Development (EDD) and Behavior Driven Development spearheaded the remainder of the process.
